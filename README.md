# Features & Functionality
- Extensive use of Flexbox for all major layout components, ensuring a flexible and properly aligned structure.
- Utilization of appropriate structural tags (header, section, footer, etc.) for better accessibility and clarity.
- Implementation of a consistent color palette, typography, and styling to match the intended design.
- Clean and commented CSS for maintainability.
